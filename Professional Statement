I bring diligence, resourcefulness, and relentless problem-solving to cybersecurity, consistently pursuing comprehensive solutions in a rapidly evolving threat landscape. Grounded in strong ethical values, I view cybersecurity as both a technical and moral responsibility protecting not just systems, but the trust and rights of individuals. My goal is to contribute to a safer digital world through strategic, value driven security practices.
